🎓 STEAM Education with Working-Class Soul

Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics—but taught in the language of hammers and wrenches, of loading docks and shipping manifests.

Where a kid from the projects can learn physics by understanding how cranes lift containers.

Where mathematics comes alive in calculating cargo loads.

Where engineering is born from fixing what's broken with whatever's at hand.

This isn't just education—it's transformation.
